    Configuring the server

   In the bbftpd directory, run:
   % ./configure

   The configure script accepts the following standard options:

   --prefix=DIR Defines the directory to install BBFTP server

   The configure script accepts the following additional options:

   --with-gzip Enable compression (automatic search + dynamic link)
   (DEFAULT)
   --with-gzip=DIR Enable compression where libs are in DIR/lib and
   includes in DIR/include (static link)
   --without-gzip Disable compression
   --with-ssl Enable encryption (automatic search + dynamic link)
   (DEFAULT)
   --with-ssl=DIR Enable encryption where libs are in DIR/lib and
   includes in DIR/include (static link)
   --with-rfio Enable RFIO interface (automatic search in "/usr/local",
   static link) (DEFAULT)
   --with-rfio=DIR Enable RFIO interface where libs are in DIR/lib and
   includes in DIR/include (static link)
   --without-rfio Disable RFIO interface
   --with-afs Use AFS for standard authentication
   --with-afs=DIR Use AFS for standard authentication where libs are in
   DIR/lib and includes in DIR/include
   --without-afs Do not use AFS for standard authentication (DEFAULT)
   --with-pam Use PAM
   --without-pam Do not use PAM (DEFAULT)
   --with-ephemeral-ports-range=RANGE The server will choose data ports
   in range RANGE, defined as MINPORT:MAXPORT
   --without-ephemeral-ports-range The server will choose data ports in
   the system-dependent default range (DEFAULT)
   --enable-authentication=private Use the private authentication module
   --enable-authentication=certificates Use the certificate
   authentication module

   The following options should be used in certificate mode only:

   --with-gsi=DIR Defines where to find the Globus GSI software
   (DEFAULT=$GLOBUS_LOCATION or "/opt/globus", static link)
   --with-x509-user-cert=FILE Defines where to find the host certificate
   (DEFAULT=/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem)
   --with-x509-user-key=FILE Defines where to find the host private key
   (DEFAULT=/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem)
   --with-x509-cert-dir=DIR Defines where to find the CA certificates
   (DEFAULT=/etc/grid-security/certificates)
   --with-gridmap=FILE Defines where to find the gridmap file
   (DEFAULT=/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile)

    Building the server

   In the bbftpd directory, run:
   % make

    Installing the server

   In the bbftpd directory, run:
   % make install

    Configuration

   It is possible to make the daemon start with options defined in a
   configuration file. This file is /etc/bbftpd.conf. The syntax is the
   same of the configuration file for client users (.bbftprc). Available
   options are described in the BBFTPD man page

    Post installation

   If you have chosen to run the server through inetd
     * Add the line
       bbftp    CONTROLPORT/tcp
       in your /etc/services file where CONTROLPORT is the number you
       have set in the includes/config.h (usually 5021)
     * Add the line
       bbftp stream tcp nowait root ${bindir}/bbftpd bbftpd
       in the /etc/inetd.conf

   If your system authentication is PAM

     * If you have a /etc/pam.conf file
          + Verify the lines begining by other auth and other account
            allow login. If it is not the case add special lines for
            bbftp. The lines to be added will look like:
            bbftp auth required /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so shadow nullok
            bbftp account required /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so 

     * If you have a /etc/pam.d directory
          + Verify the file other and allow login. If it is not the case
            create a new file called bbftp which will contain two lines
            looking like:
            auth required /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so shadow nullok
            account required /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so 

   The name of the PAM library may change.

   If you have chosen to run the server as a daemon
     * Modify the script ${prefix}/etc/bbftpd to add the options you need
       and to change the values of the GSI variables if you did not use
       the --with-x509 options during the configuration process.
     * To start the daemon run:
       ${prefix}/etc/bbftpd start
     * To stop the daemon, run:
       ${prefix}/etc/bbftpd stop
     * To restart the daemon (stop and start), run:
       ${prefix}/etc/bbftpd restart
     * To see the daemon's status, run:
       ${prefix}/etc/bbftpd status
